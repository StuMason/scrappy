Each nine has its own signature Par 3, each of which would probably find a place on any comparable course in the UK, if not further afield. If you get a par on the Red 8th, the Blue 14th or the Green 2nd then you will have played very well indeed. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

Complementing this, the player is frequently treated to grand views, as the rise and fall of an interesting topography unfolds, enhancing an architecture which, over the last century, has influenced the thinking of many course designers. As great golf vistas go that from the 11th tee with its commanding view of the 5th and 6th holes offers a glorious reward for the player who is able to pause for a moment before taking the driver from the bag.

On almost every hole there is an abundance of large sand dunes which establishes the undulating character of the course and makes it unique. Unlike most other courses the fairways are just as undulating and it is seldom that a completely flat stance can be obtained other than on the tees. As with all traditional seaside links, the wind is a major factor which has to be taken into account when deciding on club and shot selection. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

Kidd Jnr is one of the rising stars of golf course design and was recently unveiled as the man who will design the new No.7 course in St Andrews for the St Andrews Links Trust.Queenwood opened a couple of years ago and has been praised for its demanding test of golf. The key elements that enabled a new heathland course to be created were the classic shaping of greens and tees, rectangular tees lay in diagonals and the large greens that sit seamlessly in their environment with rolling contours and draped edges. This is, quite simply, a gem. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

Whilst the white tees will test the skills and patience of the very best golfers, there is much satisfaction to be obtained from playing the friendlier front tees. Played this course?

Having hosted Opens, PGA and Amateur Championships and Walker and Curtis Cups, it has been witness to more golfing history than any other in England. It was also the setting, in the guise of Royal St Mark\u2019s, of golf\u2019s most famous fictional match, the contest between James Bond and Goldfinger.Designed by William Laidlaw Purves in 1887, it has constantly evolved to pose a tough test for championship and more modest players alike. In common with many links, it is characterised by humps and swales, dunes and wild rough, fast-running fairways and deep bunkers. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

Golf World magazine assembled a panel of experts to decide the top 100 courses in England and, given that there are over 2,000 of them, that is no easy task.The panel voted the Old Course #42 in the country and included our West Course in the next best 100 saying of it, \"Like its sister a superb moorland-heathland with no bunkers. Some really excellent holes and, for some on the panel, should join its sister in the main list.\u201dSet in the heart of the Ashdown Forest, one of the things that golf lovers most appreciate about playing here is that so little has changed over the club\u2019s 125 year history. Heather, humps, hollows, pools and streams remain nature\u2019s defence against shooting a low score.Situated approximately 30 miles (48 km) south of London in East Sussex, there are only four other courses in East and West Sussex that make Golf World's top 100 and none, apart from Royal Ashdown, that can boast two in the top 200 courses in England.This beautiful golf club was founded in 1888, and within a year had opened a designated ladies\u2019 course set in mature heathland. Today both award winning courses are available to play in the same day. Without question this is the best 36-hole golf club in Sussex \u2014 and not a sand bunker in sight!Whereas the Old Course remains very much a classic heathland layout the West Course snakes its way through the heart of the Ashdown Forest, that spreads for over 20 square miles in this most beautiful part of Sussex, and has been named the best course under 6,000 yards in the UK by Golf World magazine.What about after golf?Each course has its own area of the clubhouse: The Old Course clubhouse may look somewhat austere perched half way up its hill but is a great place of fun. The West Course extension opened in 2004, with all the modern facilities, seating for up to 60 people and is open year-round.Society Day on your calendar?Let us help. In fact, let us take care of every last detail.The quality of the courses, the reputation of the dining rooms and the friendly ambience of the Club make this a favourite venue for Old Boys' matches, society days, charity days, and corporate events.Here at Royal Ashdown we especially welcome enquiries from event organisers seeking a venue that can provide two 18-hole courses for golfers to play in one day.We\u2019d love to host your foursome, your group or any occasion you see fit to spend the day on one of the finest tracts of golf in the British Isles. And one last things, the old temporary tee boxes on the West are all being upgraded, with completion due this year. So come next Winter they will all be in top condition. Played this course?

The heather comes into play and the holes progressively become more challenging.  There are six par fours measuring over 400 yards in length; the 5th, Stroke Index 1, is a massive 469 yards from the white tees. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

Founded in 1890 the Club has a proud heritage and today is a private members' club with an unassuming style which conceals a very special place for both members and visitors to enjoy the game we love.Often considered the best inland course in Kent, during its history Wildernesse has been honored to host many prestigious golf tournaments and is currently used by the R&A as a Regional Qualifying Course for The Open until 2019.Whether you are planning to visit us for the day, would like to join our membership or wish to hire our facilities for a private occasion we look forward to hearing from you and welcoming you.Henry Longhurst, the renowned golf writer and commentator wrote of Wildernesse:\u201cI often think that golf is something of a sin in such a lovely setting.The plodding golfer, his eyes glued to the ground and his thought confined to the prosaic details of his task, sees nothing of the beauty that is on every hand\u201d Played this course?

Like many great courses The Addington has the advantage of an ideal site. The fairways wander through mature pine and birch trees which create a real feeling of intimacy, yet the course still affords expansive views of the metropolis from hilltop tees like that at the 14th & 16th. Recent renovations and fairway irrigation bring the Addington to another level for the modern-day game.Ranked in Golf World\u2019s Top 100 Courses, Great Britain and Ireland and undeniably one of the finest courses in the South East, The Addington provides a true test of golf which continuously challenges and one that you will never tire of.For those wishing to take up premium golf membership and join an established, traditional golf club, we offer options for both Individual and Corporate membership. Who knows, your name may even join the Honours Board alongside that of King George VI!Crystal Palace's towering mast looms in the foreground, while the NatWest Tower, Canary Wharf and the 'Shard' provide a marvellous contrast to the rich woodland.

The course includes two loops of nine, each beginning and ending at the clubhouse. The first nine are comparatively flat whilst the second are sited in much more undulating terrain with terrific views of Surrey and Sussex. Recent upgrades by Frank Pont have restored Colt\u2019s playing characteristics and strategic options. The club hosted the 2014 English Womens Open Amateur Strokeplay championship and the course is ranked in Golf Monthly\u2019s Top 100 Courses in UK & Ireland for 2017/18. The restaurant is acknowledged to serve food which is among the best in any clubhouse. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

It continues to surprise first-time visitors with its neat and tidy layout and plush fairways. It is a parkland type course built on free draining chalky downland and, as such, is ideal for winter golf although fairway watering ensures superb condition all year round. Whilst not a long course at 6106 yards, it provides a good golfing challenge. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

We acquire independent reports on a regular basis and use these to continuallyimprove the course. Testament to this was being appointed by England Golf to host the England v France International match and the Brabazon Southern Qualifier in May 2012. Donald Steel attended the match and commented \"The staging of an event as important as England's match with France is another stamp of approval for Rochester & Cobham and showed how well the course's challenge appeals to all tastes and skills. There is plenty of reward for fine play but, at a less exalted level, there are no daunting carries, nohidden terrors, no endless searching for balls and no vast water hazards. It teases rather than torments, the overwhelming feeling is of a delightful place to play\".Rochester and Cobham is conveniently situated ten minutes from the M25 and Dartford Crossing in Kent. Easily reached from London by car or train we are ten minutes' drive from Ebbsfleet International where trains run four times an hour to London St Pancras and take only 17 minutes. We offer a friendly atmosphere, excellent golfing facilities and a clubhouse with a relaxing environment. We are proud to be a members club but we are nevertheless delighted to welcome visitors and societies. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

Few can doubt the beauty of the West Surrey course with its tree-lined fairways and contrasting scenes of the Surrey landscape. The course winds slowly upwards towards its highest point 440 feet above sea level, round the 16th tee. From there, apart from a teasing climb to the 17th, it begins a gentle descent back to the clubhouse and it is not fanciful imagination to say that it has the tranquillity and charm of a bygone age.Opened in 1910, the course was designed by the the renowned architect of that time, W Herbert Fowler, who created nearly 40 courses in England, Scotland, Wales and America, most famously Walton Heath.

With an investment of over 500,000 over the past few years redesigning and improving the greens Piltdown can now safely say it has some of the best greens in the area adding an extra dimension to an already challenging heather-lined 18 hole course.  The new putting green for Spring 2019, a covered driving range and short game area all add to the excellent facilities available.  Along with a very welcoming period clubhouse and superb catering Piltdown is an experience not to be missed. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

With spectacular views across Kent, the course offers a challenge to golfers of all abilities. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

The course is excellent, especially around the magnificent series of holes coming before the turn in a picturesque valley known as Deep Bottom that rises up towards Cissbury Ring, the site of an old Roman Fort.The Upper Course provides an interesting contrast to the Lower Course. With a total length of 5211 yards against the 6505 yards of the Lower, it is a less exacting test for the handicap player.  However, its smaller scale requires greater accuracy and allows fewer margins for error.Both courses command breathtaking views of the English Channel, the finest provided by the holes around the turn on the Upper Course.  They offer you a panoramic view of the whole stretch of the Channel from the Seven Sisters to the east across to the Isle of Wight in the west. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

The land was then owned by Mr Hugh Locke-King whose other extensive holdings included the famous 'Brooklands' race track. The members took the opportunity to purchase the course in 1922 and changed the name from Bleakdown to West Byfleet Golf Club thereby exhibiting both outstanding foresight and taste. The original course was designed by Cuthbert Butchart, a much respected professional of his time, whose projects included Worplesdon, West Hill, Hunstanton and Royal County Down. Although the odd hole has been lost and others changed, the majority of the course remains faithful to the original design. The course is mostly level with just the odd gradient to add some variation. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

Celebrating its Centenary year the course is renowned for its mature fairways and subtle greens.  From the moment you drive up the hill to the Clubhouse you are greeted with the towering pine trees. The hilly course offers some beautiful views; the tee require accuracy, even the short par 4's need careful thought! The big undulating greens and memorable 18th hole make it a good challenge. It's a course with lots of character, as one of the great Harry Colt's lesser mentioned pieces of golf course architecture, one for the connoisseur to truly appreciate. Played this course?

The club began life in 1896 as Acton Golf Club and moved to its present location in 1920. The parkland course measures 6307 yards, with a par of 70 (SSS 70) and has many of the recognisable characteristics that made Harry Colt one of the greatest of all course designers. Colt felt that early holes should not be demanding and that using every club in the bag throughout a round is ideal. He also thought the routing of the course should be determined by the land and that is clear to see at Sudbury. Harry Colt was also responsible for such great courses as Wentworth (East/West), Sunningdale, Moor Park, Stoke Park, St Georges Hill to name a few. You won't be disappointed! Played this course?

The course, with its predominantly sandy soil, is usually dry underfoot and drains quickly in the wettest of weather for excellent playing conditions all year round. Played this course?

With a par of 71, The East was used as a venue for Open qualifying from 1992 to 1997, the course is also the stage for the first 36 holes of the Waterford Trophy, a 72 hole scratch medal open to any amateur with a handicap of 4 or better. This tournament attracts the top amateur players in the Country.  The East is a testing but fair challenge, newcomers are inspired by both its quality of design and playing condition.The WEST COURSE opens with a yawning par 4, some 434yards with a magnificent panorama leading down to the Chinbrook.  The West has its own unique character, a truly testing but beautiful par 69.  The contours are incorporated into the design to create many challenging approach shots.  Mainly tree lined with awesome views of many of London's famous landmarks the West course leaves an impression and a yearning to return. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

It is a good test of golf, and is extremely playable in the winter due to the chalk base providing excellent drainage.These peaceful surroundings offer a challenging course with magnificent panoramic views of the Sussex Weald with its famous windmills Jack and Jill. Blankets of native bluebells and wild orchids, secretive badgers, shy deer, stoats and kestrels are but a few of the delights. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

The Club is one of the best downland courses in the south of England with its glorious views of the Sussex Downs on one side and the English Channel on the other.Designed in 1907 by J H Taylor, five times Open champion, the downland course has stood the test of time.  There has been one major revision to the layout in 1911 otherwise it has remained unchanged apart from additional length and some modifications to bunkers.  Being set high overlooking the English Channel the view to the east is the start of the Seven Sisters and to the west the Port of Newhaven. Inland there are views across the Downs and to the walking territory of the South Downs way. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

It was designed by W. Herbert Fowler and was described by James Braid, five-times winner of the British Open, as 'a good sporting course'. It is a good test of golf for players of all abilities, combining the fun of links-style golf with constantly changing battles with the wind blowing in from Beachy Head. Age too, is no barrier, as the springy turf is always pleasant to walk on and the undulations are gentle enough for the most mature of players. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

The first is a gentle start but look out for the railway. Indeed, all the early holes require solid tee shots, and generally favour the player who draws the ball, as most of the trouble is found on the right of many fairways. The course features some beautiful landscaped and challenging holes, many with excellent views of the North Downs and the beautiful surrounding Kent countryside. Played this course?

Improvements were also designed by Harry Colt. Although the course has undergone continuous improvement over the years, care has been taken to preserve Braid's unique approach to green and bunker design.Tyrrells Wood is located on the edge of the North Downs and in common with much of the area has a chalk subsoil, which provides extremely good drainage. The typical downland nature of the area was transformed by the substantial tree planting programme implemented in the late 19th century, to provide a unique downland / parkland character.

Overlooking the ruins of the old Cowdray House, golf was first played here in 1904 and the course has now matured into what is without doubt one of the most beautiful tracks in the south east. Measuring 6,212 yards, the par 70 layout boasts the very latest in fairway irrigation and sprinkler systems and together with its sandy soil, is able to maintain its superb condition throughout the whole year.

Several existing and some man-made lakes and strategically placed bunkers ensure that Clandon Regis is a good test of golf for players of all abilities. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

You should read the suggestions noted on each of the hole pages and perhaps they will be of some help. Although the club is located on the South Coast the course lies on a North-South Axis. It runs out for 9 holes with the prevailing South West wind at your back.Many professional and amateur golfers have enjoyed playing this course, among them the great Harry Vardon. Played this course?

In 1927 the course opened for play and it has been evolving ever since. Our 80th year has seen changes to the 18th hole. A reshape and reinstatement of the traditional gorse and broom has made the closing hole at Canterbury one of the best. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

As with most downland courses, the degree of difficulty varies according to the strength and direction of the wind. With a stiff sea breeze blowing up from the Channel, the wide fairways often seem narrow and the strategically placed bunkers play their part.Among the attractive points of the layout of the course is the contrast between the long hard-hitting holes on the western side of the ridge and the holes of a more adventurous type on the eastern side.

The course measures 6,295 yards, par 71 for men and 5,546 yards par 72 for ladies.  Trees are the key feature, with many holes calling for an accurate tee shot \u2013 length often not being as critical. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

The course is situated on top of the Downs and so the wind often plays an important role in determining the success or otherwise of a round. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

The Clubhouse, a luxurious Georgian Mansion, is steeped in history and dates back to 1726. The Golf Club was established in 1907 by the Guinness family.The Old and New golf courses offer two contrasting challenges. The Old course, designed by Willie Park and opened in 1907, is a mature course known as one of the finest in Surrey. The New Course with greens built to USGA specifications, is modern in style and incorporates many water hazards including the river Mole. Both provide an interesting round of golf for all players.

A visit is a must to this downland golf course designed by John Jacobs Associates just half a mile from Selsdon Park (just a couple of minutes' drive away).The Orange Course (Yellow 9 & Red 9) - This impressive downland layout was designed by former Ryder Cup legend John Jacobs and has been carved through two landscaped valleys. Set in 350 acres of mature Surrey land, this testing course utilises many natural features, USGA standard greens and is surrounded by a bird sanctuary. 18 holes. Par 72. 6395 yards. Parkland.The Green Course (Blue 9 & Yellow 9) - The Green Course at Farleigh is a very decent and challenging test of golf. Like the Orange course, it incorporates the surrounding natural woodland to produce some very interesting holes. 18 holes. Par 72. 6568 yards. Parkland. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

When the golf course designers moved on to the site in 1936 they found a wealth of natural features despite the basic flatness of the area. There are two or three small but significant changes in level and some marvelous sweeping contours in the terrain as it moves from open countryside through trees, bushes and shrubs. Although the setting and the entire nature of the course is parkland, there is something of a links quality about  the turf, no doubt stemming from close contact with the sea that this stretch of country enjoyed for centuries.

With many elevations, lakes and hazards the golf course is designed to challenge the most confident of players, but the well-maintained and wide fairways are forgiving to the golfing beginner too. The course suits all levels of play and is open all year round to members, visitors and hotel residents. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

With holes ranging from 60 yards up to 150 yards, it\u2019s also great for honing the short game or simply to spend a fun hour with friends and family.

The tree lined fairways make accuracy from the tee important. We have two par 5's, the 11th and 18th holes, five tricky par 3's, and the remainder par 4's of varying lengths. Each hole has a character all of it's own, and the course offers spectacular views of the surrounding area. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

The course is based high up on the very edge of White Cliffs Country between Dover and Deal, Braid designed the course around the natural landscape and made sure it was rich with panoramic views and an abundance of plants and wildlife. A stunning downland course set atop the White Cliffs offering great views of the Channel. An excellent winter golf course. Played this course? Tell us what you thought.

The par 73, 18-hole course plays 6,443 yards off the back tees and makes superb use of the mature oak woodlands on which it was built. Strategically placed water hazards and bunkers along with tree lined fairways makes accuracy a premium and the course rewarding for all standards of play. Situated a stones throw from Effingham Junction railway on the main line from London Waterloo, and a short drive from the A3/M25 junction, the club is easily accessible and the perfect escape from the bustle of the city.
